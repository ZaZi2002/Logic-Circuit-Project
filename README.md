# Project Title: 8-bit Counter System with Display and TTL Interface
![Uploading 1.jpgâ€¦]()

## Overview

This project implements an 8-bit counter system using Proteus simulation. The system displays the counter values on a 7-segment display and includes a TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) interface. The counter starts from 1 and increments based on external clock input, supporting manual and automatic modes of operation. A Proteus file is included for the hardware simulation.

## Features

- **8-bit counter**: The system counts from 1 to 255.
- **Manual and automatic operation**: The counter can be incremented either manually or automatically based on an external clock signal.
- **7-segment display**: The counter value is shown on a 7-segment display.
- **TTL interface**: A TTL-compatible interface is used to handle the input clock signal.
- **Hardware simulation**: The Proteus simulation file allows users to test the functionality of the system virtually.

## System Requirements

- **Proteus software**: To run the provided Proteus file.
- **TTL logic**: The system uses standard TTL logic for input and output operations.

## How It Works

1. The system uses an 8-bit counter that can be manually or automatically incremented.
2. The counter values are displayed on a 7-segment display for easy visualization.
3. A TTL signal is used as the clock input to drive the counter.
4. The system is tested in a Proteus simulation environment to verify its operation.

## Proteus Simulation

- The project includes a Proteus file for running simulations.
- Users can simulate the counter operation and visualize how the 7-segment display updates with each count.
